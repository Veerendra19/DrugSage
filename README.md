About This Project:
The Drug Recommendation System is designed to assist healthcare providers in prescribing the most suitable medications for their patients. It uses advanced algorithms to analyze patient data, including medical history, current health status, and potential drug interactions. By providing personalized drug recommendations, the system aims to improve treatment outcomes, reduce the risk of adverse reactions, and streamline the medication prescribing process.

How to Use It:
Data Input: Enter the patientâ€™s medical history, current health status, and any other relevant information into the system.
Analysis: The system processes the input data using its machine learning algorithms to identify the best possible medication options.
Recommendations: Review the personalized drug recommendations provided by the system. Each recommendation includes information on efficacy, potential side effects, and any interactions with other medications.
Prescription: Choose the most appropriate medication from the recommendations and proceed with prescribing it to the patient.
